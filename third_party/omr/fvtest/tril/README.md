# Tril

Tril is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for generating the Testarossa
Intermediate Language (IL). Its goal is to simplify testing Testarossa by
providing very fine control over the IL that is fed into the compiler.

## Overview

The Tril implementation is a small library with a parser and IL generator,
located in the `tril/` directory. It provides the core tools for dealing with
Tril code. Compilation and executing of Tril code is implemented separately.
This allows custom tools to be easily developed on top of Tril.

The `examples/` directory contains examples demonstrating how to implement
compilation and execution of Tril code.

The `test/` directory contains some GTest-based test cases for Tril.

## Building Tril

1. Make sure you have the latest versions of cmake, flex, and yacc installed
on your machine

2. Clone the Eclipse OMR repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse/omr.git
    ```

3. Build tril using `cmake`. To ensure OMR gets built in a compatible
   configuration, we currently reccomend you use the CMake cache that drives
   our TravisCI builds.

    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -C../cmake/caches/Travis.cmake ..
    ```

    At this point you can use whatever generated build system to build
    tril: 

    ```
    make tril
    ```

5. You should now have a static archive called `libtril.a`

6. You can build the tests by building `triltest`, or the compiler tests built
   using tril by by building `comptest`. There's also the `mandelbrot` and `incordec` 
   examples.

4. Enjoy the view!

   ```
   ./fvtest/tril/examples/mandelbrot/mandelbrot ../fvtest/tril/examples/mandelbrot/mandelbrot.tril
   ```

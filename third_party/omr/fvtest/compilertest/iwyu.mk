# include-what-you-use, or iwyu, is a open source tool based on clang
# that is used to analyse C++ source paths. It will check files that it's
# given for uses of objects, and suggest including the necessary
# forward declaration or header file. It will also suggest removing any
# unneccessary headers which do not contain anything used by the file.
#
# A few notes on using iwyu and this makefile:
#
#  - iwyu is hosted on gitlab and has precompiled releases available
#  - Before using this makefile, make sure iwyu is somewhere in your $PATH
#  - iwyu will use the exact include path for whatever definition is
#    needed. That means if a member of the OMR layer of an extensible
#    class is needed, iwyu will suggest the OMR version of the file. To
#    solve this, a mapping file is used to force the inclusion of the
#    most derived class. Some glibc libraries and gtest also
#    run into the same problem; iwyu has provided some mapping files for
#    such cases.
#  - iwyu will also scan the first included file of the input file if
#    it's the relevant header.
#  - iwyu (and by extension this makefile) only scans the file; it does
#    not make the changes for you.
#  - If you want to automatically make the changes, pipe the output of
#    iwyu into the fix_includes.py tool from the iwyu devs. Note that this
#    may fail to do the correct thing if run on files with ifdef-ed
#    includes.
#  - BE CAREFUL WHEN REMOVING INCLUDES FROM HEADERS. If another file
#    includes the modified header and was relying on the header to include
#    a certain file, then removing the include will cause the other file
#    to fail to compile.
#
#  - Incremental builds are unfortunately broken. When they are fixed, the
#    suggested workflow will be building files one by one and making the
#    changes as you go.
#  - iwyu doesn't return 0 even when includes are correct; this makefile
#    will not stop upon failing to compile a file.
#  - The latest precompiled version of iwyu (git:f09b88a) fails to scan
#    OMRCodeGenerator.cpp: running it results in a segfault.
#
# Using this makefile:
#
#   To run iwyu on all files:
#
# PLATFORM=foo-bar-gcc make -f iwyu.mk
#
#   To run iwyu on a specific file:
#
# PLATFORM=foo-bar-gcc make -f iwyu.mk JIT_CPP_FILES='$file'
#
# Paths are relative to the source root, e.g. compiler/il/OMRNode.cpp
#

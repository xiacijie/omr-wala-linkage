 * @brief Memory map
 *
 * This module provides memory mapping facilities that allow a user to map files
 * into the virtual address space of the process.  There are various options that
 * can be used when mapping a file into memory, such as copy on write.  Not all 
 * of these options are available on all platforms, @ref omrmmap_capabilities
 * provides the list of supported options.  Note also that on some platforms 
 * memory mapping facilites do not exist at all. On these platforms the API will
 * still be available, but will simply read the file into allocated memory.

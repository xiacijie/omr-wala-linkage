 * so arn't detailed here. If no heap is specified then this function will use malloc to allocate
 * the memory necessary for the stack frame structures which must be freed by the caller.
 *
 * This function is called via the omrintrospect_backtrace_thread function that provides signal protection
 *
 * @param portLbirary a pointer to an initialized port library
 * @param threadInfo the thread structure we want  to attach the backtrace to. Must not be NULL.
 * @param heap a heap from which to allocate any necessary memory. If NULL malloc is used instead.
 * @param signalInfo a platform signal context. If not null the context held in threadInfo is replaced
 *  	  with the signal context before the backtrace is generated.
 *
 * @return the number of frames in the backtrace.
